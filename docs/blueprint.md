## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Cool airport blue (#3A6EA5) inspired by the travel environment, providing a modern and trustworthy feel.
- Background color: Near-black (#0B0D10) providing a sleek and premium look with excellent contrast for content.
- Accent color: Soft steel-blue (#8AA5BF), an analogous color used for highlights and interactive elements, ensuring a cohesive aesthetic.
- Font: 'Inter', a clean geometric sans-serif font for headlines and body text, offering a modern and readable experience. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use a consistent set of clean, line icons for problem/solution section. Employ chevron mark subtly across UI elements (CTAs, dividers) for brand consistency.
- Maintain a minimal layout with generous whitespace. Use a grid system for organizing content in a clear, accessible manner.
- Implement smooth, subtle animations. Examples: fade and y-translate section reveals, hover-triggered chevron slides, soft scale-in modal.
